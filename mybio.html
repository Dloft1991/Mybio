<p> I am a 27 year old Florida native. I have a 5 year old daughter with my fiance. 
    I currently work from home as an AppleCare Senior Advisor. I enjoy being outside playing
    basketball, swimming, and blowing bubbles with my daughter. My goals in life are to become
    a developer for Apple or work for myself as a freelance web developer.
